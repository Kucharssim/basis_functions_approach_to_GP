# Basis function approximation to Gaussian processes 
Approximate eigendecomposition of the covariance function of a Gaussian process. The method is based on interpreting the covariance function as the kernel of a pseudo-differential operator and approximating it using Hilbert space methods. This results in a reduced-rank approximation for the covariance function (Solin and Särkkä, 2018).
# Contents in the repository so far
So far, the repository containts the STAN codes of some models, such as regular Gaussian processes, basis function approximation to Gaussian processes and splines-based models. There are unidimensional and multidimensional versions of these code, and they are particularized to different datasets.
