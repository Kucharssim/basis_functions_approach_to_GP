# Basis function approximation to Gaussian process  
Approximate eigendecomposition of the covariance function of a Gaussian process. The method is based on interpreting the covariance function as the kernel of a pseudo-differential operator and approximating it using Hilbert space methods. This results in a reduced-rank approximation for the covariance function (Solin and Särkkä, 2018).
